This section covers the Binary Tree data structure, a fundamental concept in computer science used for hierarchical data representation.

Definition and Structure: Explained a binary tree as a tree data structure where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left and right child.

Types of Binary Trees: Discussed various types, including full binary trees, complete binary trees, balanced binary trees, and binary search trees (BST), highlighting their unique properties and use cases.

Basic Operations: Demonstrated key operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal methods (in-order, pre-order, and post-order), providing code examples for clarity.

Applications: Illustrated practical applications of binary trees, including expression parsing, implementing priority queues (via binary heaps), and searching and sorting algorithms.

Advantages and Disadvantages: Analyzed the benefits of using binary trees for efficient data organization and retrieval, while also addressing challenges like balancing and potential inefficiencies in unbalanced trees.
